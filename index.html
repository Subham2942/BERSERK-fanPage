        Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guts_(Berserk)" target="blank" class="bold link">Guts</a>, 
        a lone mercenary, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berserk_characters#Griffith" target="blank" class="bold link">Griffith</a>, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk".
        
        </p>
        <p class="p-1"> 
        Berserk explores a wide range of themes and topics. Free will, destiny, and causality are discussed within the series.
        Human resilience is a recurring theme, with many characters coming from horrible backgrounds, constantly struggling against an unjust world. 
        Guts struggles with destiny itself and is constantly resisting the pull of predetermination. Griffith also embodies this idea of resilience, 
        by chasing his dream of ruling his own kingdom, despite his lowborn origins, as well as free will, by his own decision to sacrifice the Band of the Hawk 
        in order to achieve his dream.

        The first thing that comes to mind is the absolutly beautiful art in this manga; 
        this manga ran for over 30 years and the quality of art just kept increasing over the years.
      </p>
      <p class="p-1">
        And if that wasnt enough, Berserk has a really well-written story set in a very interesting fantasy world.
        The journey Guts goes through is really great. Its a shame we might never see the end of his journey, but it is still worth it to follow his heartbreaking
        yet amazing story.

        <a href="https://readberserk.com/chapter/berserk-chapter-099-005/" target="blank" class="bold link">Berserk: The Prototype</a> is the precursor to and basis for Berserk, and is not part of the official canon. It was made in 1988, 
        while Kentarou Miura was still in college. The prototype was released in English on December 6, 2006 as a bonus in volume 14 by 
        <a href="https://www.darkhorse.com/" target="blank" class="link bold">Dark Horse Comics</a> .
      </p>
      <p class="p-1">
        Though Berserk: The Prototype greatly shares the same intent as Berserk, various details, world views, characters, etc., differ 
        noticeably from those of its successor.
